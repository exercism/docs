# Track

A track consists of many different parts.

## Metadata

The track's configuration and metadata are specified in the `config.json` file. It lists the track's exercises, concepts, editor settings, and much more. Checkout the [config.json documentation](/docs/building/tracks/config-json).

## Concepts

All concept and practices exercises of a track involve _concepts_. These concepts are separate entities by themselves. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/concepts) for more information.

The concepts taught in the track's concept exercises form a _syllabus_.
The _syllabus_ is shown to students as a _concept map_.
Check the [_concept map_ documentation](/docs/building/tracks/concept-map) to learn about building out the concept map for a _syllabus_.

For more information on how to design a syllabus, check the [syllabus documentation](/docs/building/tracks/syllabus).

## Exercises

Tracks have two types of exercises:

- Concept exercises: they are designed to teach one or more concepts to a student. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/concept-exercises) for more information.
- Practice exercises: they are designed to practice learned concepts. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises) for more information.

### Dig deeper

Each exercise has an optional Dig Deeper section that can contain:

- [Approaches](/docs/building/tracks/approaches): different ways in which the exercise can be solved
- [Articles](/docs/building/tracks/articles): describe interesting aspects of the exercise
- Community videos: videos that showcase the exercise, usually by having someone solve the exercise from scratch

## Shared files

Some files are not specific to individual exercises, but are instead applicable to _all_ exercises. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/shared-files) for more information.

## Docs

Each track has a couple of required documentation files. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/docs) for more information.

## Widgets

Some parts of the track can be displayed in [widgets](/docs/building/markdown/widgets).

## Style guide

All documents should adhere to the [style guide](/docs/building/markdown/style-guide). Markdown documents
should also adhere to our [Markdown standards](/docs/building/markdown/markdown).

## Maintenance

### Avoiding triggering unnecessary test runs

When you merge a track PR that touches an exercise, it triggers the latest published iteration of students' solutions to be re-tested.
For popular exercises, this is a _very_ expensive operation (70,000 test runs for Python Hello World as an extreme!).

**We encourage you to try and avoid doing this unnecessarily.**

Solutions **will not** be retested if the merged commit either:

- only touches `.docs` or `.meta` files, or other files that users don't interact with
- or contains `[no important files changed]` in the commit body.

Solutions **will** be re-tested if the merged commit both:

- lacks `[no important files changed]` in the commit body
- and touches one of the following files for an exercise (as specified in its `.meta/config.json` file):
  - test files
  - editor files
  - invalidator files

Some examples:

- [Python#3423](https://github.com/exercism/python/pull/3423): Only touches docs so no tests were run
- [Python#3437](https://github.com/exercism/python/commit/29a64a4889f94bafbd0062d7fc5052858523b25c): Was merged with `[no important files changed]` added, so no tests were run
- [Csharp#2138](https://github.com/exercism/csharp/pull/2138): Whitespace was removed from tests. The keyword was **not** added. Tests were re-run unnecessarily.
