# Track

A track consists of many different parts.

## Metadata

The track's configuration and metadata are specified in the `config.json` file. It lists the track's exercises, concepts, editor settings, and much more. Checkout the [config.json documentation](./config-json.md).

## Concepts

All concept and practices exercises of a track involve _concepts_. These concepts are separate entities by themselves. Check the [documentation](./concepts.md) for more information.

## Exercises

Tracks have two types of exercises:

- Concept exercises: they are designed to teach one or more concepts to a student. Check the [documentation](./concept-exercises.md) for more information.
- Practice exercise: they are designed to practice learned concepts. Check the [documentation](./practice-exercises.md) for more information.

## Shared files

Some files are not specific to individual exercises, but are instead applicable to _all_ exercises. Check the [documentation](./shared-files.md) for more information.

## Config

## Widgets

Some parts of the track can be displayed in [widgets](./widgets.md), such as [concepts](./widgets.md#conceptwidget) and [exercises](./widgets.md#exercisewidget).

## Style guide

All documents should adhere to the [style guide](../../contributing/standards/style-guide.md). Markdown documents should also adhere to our [Markdown standards](../../contributing/standards/markdown.md).
