# Track

A track consists of many different parts.

## Metadata

The track's configuration and metadata are specified in the `config.json` file. It lists the track's exercises, concepts, editor settings, and much more. Checkout the [config.json documentation](/docs/building/tracks/config-json).

## Concepts

All concept and practices exercises of a track involve _concepts_. These concepts are separate entities by themselves. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/concepts) for more information.

## Exercises

Tracks have two types of exercises:

- Concept exercises: they are designed to teach one or more concepts to a student. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/concept-exercises) for more information.
- Practice exercises: they are designed to practice learned concepts. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises) for more information.

## Shared files

Some files are not specific to individual exercises, but are instead applicable to _all_ exercises. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/shared-files) for more information.

## Docs

Each track has a couple of required documentation files. Check the [documentation](/docs/building/tracks/docs) for more information.

## Widgets

Some parts of the track can be displayed in [widgets](/docs/building/markdown/widgets).

## Style guide

All documents should adhere to the [style guide](/docs/building/markdown/style-guide). Markdown documents
should also adhere to our [Markdown standards](/docs/building/markdown/markdown).
