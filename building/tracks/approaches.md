# Approaches

Each exercise can have approaches associated with them, which describe the different ways in which an exercise can be solved.

## Approach

An approach should explore how an exercise can be solved a certain way.

- Its contents should either:
  - Explore an idiomatic approach
  - Explore a non-idiomatic, but interesting approach
  - Contain a meta discussion (e.g. comparing the performance of approaches)
- Include code samples
- Feel free to dig deep into the topic
- Link to useful resources (e.g. documentation)

## Approach overview

- Give context to the problem
  - Describe important points (e.g. gotchas) that apply to _all_ approaches
- Discuss the most idiomatic approaches
  - Each approach should show a snippet illustrating the approach
  - Keep the content fairly high-level
    - Link to the idiomatic approach for more information
- Discuss how to choose between the approaches
  - What are the trade-offs?
  - Are some approaches better suited for specific use cases?

## What exercises to write approaches for?

In general, [Practice Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises) are more suitable to write approaches for, as they usually can be solved in multiple ways.

For [Concept Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/concept-exercises), discussing the exemplar approach might be interesting. For example, you could show how the concept being taught makes certain code easier to write.
