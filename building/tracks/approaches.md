# Approaches

Each exercise can have approaches associated with them, which describe the different ways in which an exercise can be solved.

There are two different types of approach documents:

- Approaches introduction
- Detailed approaches

## Approaches introduction

- Discuss the most idiomatic approaches
  - If an approach is often used by students but it is _not_ idiomatic, it might be worthwhile to discuss it too
- Discuss how to choose between the approaches
  - What are the trade-offs?
  - Are some approaches are more applicable for certain use cases?
- Keep the content fairly high-level
  - If an approach warrants a lot of detail, write it up in a detailed approach document
- Link to useful resources, which will help students dig deeper

## Detailed approaches

- Topics can include:
  - Idiomatic approaches
  - Less common, but interesting approaches
  - Meta discussions (e.g. comparing the performance of different approaches)
- Link to useful resources, which will help students dig deeper

## What exercises to write approaches for?

In general, [Practice Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises) are more suitable to write approaches for, as they usually can be solved in multiple ways.

For [Concept Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/concept-exercises), discussing the exemplar approach might be interesting. For example, you could show how the concept being taught makes certain code easier to write.
