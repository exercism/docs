# Shared files

Some documentation files apply to both [Concept Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/concept-exercises) and [Practice Exercises](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises). These cross-exercise files are located within the track's `exercises/shared/.docs` directory:

- `debug.md`: explains how a student that is coding in the browser can still do "debugging" (optional)
- `help.md`: contains track-specific-wide instructions on how to get help (required)
- `tests.md`: contains track-specific instructions on how to run the tests (required)

The [Presentation document](/docs/building/tracks/presentation) describes how these files are used to present content to the student.

---

## File: `debug.md`

**Purpose:** Explain how a student that is coding in the browser can still do "debugging"

**Presence:** Optional

The in-browser editor does not have any built-in debugging support. If the track's test runner supports capturing console output, the student can still do some form of "debugging" and this document explains how to do that.

### Example

````markdown
# Debug

To help with debugging, you can use the fact that any [console output](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/basic-input-output) will be shown in the test results window. You can write to the console using:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Debug message");
```
````

## File: `help.md`

**Purpose:** Explain how a student can get help

**Presence:** Required

Describe how a student can get help, specifically for this track (not Exercism-wide).

### Example

```markdown
# Help

If you're having trouble, feel free to ask help in the C# track's [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/exercism/csharp).
```

## File: `tests.md`

**Purpose:** Contains track-specific instructions on how to run the tests

**Presence:** Required

Describe how to run the tests for this particular exercise.

### Example

```markdown
# Tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.
```

## Overwriting

_Note: this is not yet implemented_

Exercises can overwrite the track-specific files by creating an identically named file in the exercise's `.docs` directory (e.g. `.docs/debug.md`). This should only rarely be needed (if at all).
