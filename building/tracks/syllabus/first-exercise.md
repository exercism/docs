# Syllabus - First Exercise

The first exercise should:

- Have no prerequisites
- Teach one concept: `basics`
  Usually, this means teaching them about:
  - Defining functions (or methods if your language does not have functions)
  - Calling functions
  - Passing arguments to functions
  - Assigning a value with a name (usually called variables)
  - Comment syntax
  - Naming conventions (if relevant)
  - Any other key points about your language the student _must_ know (e.g. that you need to compile things for it to work)
- Use as a little data types as possible (preferrably only integers, as their notation is the same across most languages and well known to virtually everyone)
- Aim to be concise; you don't want to overload students with information
- Many tracks have implemented a `basics` concept exercise.
  Try finding one that is closest to your track to fork your implementation from.
- Don't hesitate to ask for help.
  It is better to ask during the process rather than afterwards.
