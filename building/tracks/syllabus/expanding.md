# Syllabus - Expanding

Once you've built 5-10 concept exercises, expanding the syllabus becomes easier and easier due to having access to more concepts to build on.

Options to select an exercise:

- A concept that build on an existing concept (e.g. `time` => `timezones`)
- A concept that depends on an existing concept (e.g. `classes` => `interfaces`)

- If your concept exercise has prerequisite concepts for which no exercise exist at the moment, strongly consider making the exercise have the `wip` status.
  The reason being that for students unfamiliar with the language, and "gaps" or "jumps" will likely not be obvious at all.

- Check other tracks' syllabuses to see how they've structured their track.
  E.g. the Elixir track has a really nice syllabus progression.
