  - Good options are the core data types of your track. E.g.
    - Booleans (`true`, `false`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
    - Basic numeric types (e.g. most used integer and/or most used floating-point type)
    - Strings
    - Dates
    - Atoms
  - Other options would be core concepts like:
    - Conditionals
    - Loops
    - Arithmetic
