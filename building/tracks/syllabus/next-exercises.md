# Syllabus - Next Exercises

Having implemented your first concept exercise, the next few exercises should build on that.

We like to have three to five exercises that have no other prerequisites other than the `basics` concept.

Good options are the core primitives or data types of your language.
E.g. booleans, basic numeric types, strings, dates, and atoms.

Other good options are core concepts such as conditionals, loops, and basic arithmetic.

It's worth checking other tracks' concept exercises to see if there are any that are appropriate for your track.

Note that introducing a concept doesn't mean that you need to explain it fully in all its glory.
You can always defer complexity.
The language might have a dozen different numeric types that are useful in different scenarios.
The exercise can simply mention that there are others while introducing only the most commonly used integer type and most commonly used floating-point type.

Some core data types are too complex to introduce directly.
For example strings might be lists of chars, in which case you'd want to introduce both chars and lists separately before introducing strings.

Sometimes while working on an exercise you will realize that it's more complex than you expected.
That's totally fine.
Make a note of the concept that needs to be taught as a prerequisite.
Then pretend that such an exercise exists, and finish the exercise you're working on with that simplification in mind.
Then go back and create a new exercise for the prerequisite concept.
Remember to mark the exercise as `wip` until the prerequisite exercise has been added.
