# Pizza Slices

## Story

You have a number of pizza slice shops in your town and you want to write a web app that will let you compare two different pizza configurations to let you know who will give you the bigger slice.

## Tasks

The story facilitates exploration of [Optional types][types-option-types] which can be used to represent a value or the absence of a value.

- Write a function to compute slice sizes which returns nil for invalid input
- Process input from your web application to determine the larger slice
