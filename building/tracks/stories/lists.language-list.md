## Story

This story facilitates the exploration of [lists][types-list] in a language.

The basic premise is that a person wants to maintain a [list][types-list] of languages that they want to learn on Exercism's website.

## Tasks

- Create a list.
- Add to a list.
- Remove from a list.
- Count the length of a list.
- Get the first item from a list.
- Check if an item is a member of a list.

## Implementations

- [Clojure: lists][implementation-clojure] (reference implementation)
- [Elixir: lists][implementation-elixir]
- [F#: lists][implementation-fsharp]

## Reference

- [`types/list`][types-list]
