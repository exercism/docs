# Articles

Each exercise can have articles associated with them, which explore some interesting aspect of the exercise.

## Topics

Potential topics an article could explore:

- Comparing the performance of different approaches
- Anything interesting you can come up with!

## General considerations

- If your article is based on some code you've written, consider committing that code (within the article directory)
  - An example being an article on performance, for which benchmarking code was written

## What exercises to write articles for?

Any exercise, as long as there is something interesting to explore.
