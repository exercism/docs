# Articles

Each exercise can have articles associated with them, which explore some interesting aspect of the exercise.

## Topics

Potential topics an article could explore:

- Comparing the performance of different approaches
- Anything interesting you can come up with!

## General considerations

- If your article is based on some code you've written, consider committing that code (within the article directory)
  - An example being an article on performance, for which benchmarking code was written

## What exercises to write articles for?

Any exercise, as long as there is something interesting to explore.

## Files

Each article must add the following two files:

- `.articles/<article-slug>/content.md`: description of the article (see [the docs](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises#file-articles-article-slug-content-md))
- `.articles/<article-slug>/snippet.md`: snippet showcasing the article (see [the docs](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises#file-articles-article-slug-snippet-txt))

You'll then need to add or update:

- `.articles/config.json`: metadata for the articles (see [the docs](/docs/building/tracks/practice-exercises#file-article-config-json))
