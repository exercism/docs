# Prepare for open-source contributions from strangers

At this point you should be able to accept contributions from strangers.
Write some [contributing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

If there are exercises that you wish to include in the track, but have not yet implemented, open issues for each exercise.

Other things to consider:

- Is there a style guide for your programming language?
- Are these styles encouraged or enforced?
- Are there any conventions that we should adopt on this track for the sake of consistency?
- Can we enforce these?
- Is there a linter? Are there many? Should we use one?
- Is there a common convention for filenames? If not, what should our convention be?

It could be worth opening separate issues for the things you wish to tackle.
