# Join our community

To help interact with other maintainers (and mentors), we have created a Slack workspace.
This is a great place to plan your track and to get help from other maintainers.
It is also the place where we'll regularly post updates on things we're working on.
To get access to this workspace, please email [erik@exercism.org](mailto:erik@exercism.org?subject=Exercism Slack Access Request).
