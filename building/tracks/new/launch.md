## Launch!

In order to launch you'll need to have a handful of people who can show up most days to provide feedback on the site.

Then flip the `active` switch in `config.json` to true, and the track will show up on the [website](https://exercism.org/tracks).

From this point on, any changes to your track will be automatically synced with the [website](https://exercism.org/tracks).
