# Add initial exercises

Once you've implemented the `hello-world` exercise, the next task is to implement 20+ other exercises.

## Choose exercises

To help tracks with implementing exercises, we've created the [exercism/problem-specifications repository](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications).
This repository contains [metadata for over 100+ exercises](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/main/exercises), which different tracks can then use to implement their track-specific version of the exercises from.

Each exercise has three bits of information:

1. `description.md`: explains what the exercise is about (required)
