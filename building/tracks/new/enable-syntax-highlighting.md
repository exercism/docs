# Enable syntax highlighting

There are two types of syntax highlighting on the website:

1. Highlighting _static_ code (code snippets, iterations, and such).
   Check [static syntax highlighting docs](/docs/building/tracks/new/enable-syntax-highlighting/static) for more information.
2. Highlighting _dynamic_ code (the online editor).
   Check [dynamic syntax highlighting docs](/docs/building/tracks/new/enable-syntax-highlighting/dynamic) for more information.

```exercism/note
The requirements for static and dynamic syntax highlighting are _very_ different, which is why they use different libraries.
