# Prepare for launch

Each track has a landing page on the site.
E.g. (when logged out) https://exercism.io/tracks/go

The page is meant to entice people into wanting to try the language out.

There are four things that we need (details below):

- an icon for the track (TODO: link to track icon)
- a short blurb for the header section
- an "about" section with a bit more detail
- a code snippet that gives a visual impression of what the language syntax looks like
- maintainer bios

In order to design an icon for the site open a new issue in the [exercism/website-icons](https://github.com/exercism/website-icons/issues) repository, answering the following questions:

- Does the language have an official logo? If so
  - please include a link to an example
  - please list the attribution rights of that logo
- Does the language have an unofficial logo? If so
  - please explain the ways in which people use the unofficial logo
  - please include a link to an example
  - please list the attribution rights of that logo

For the blurb, about section, and code snippet please see the [documentation about introductory copy](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/documentation/introductory-copy.md).

The maintainer bios go in the [maintainer config](/maintaining-a-track/maintainer-configuration.md).
The goal of the bio is to give people a little bit of insight into your background with the language and why you are involved with the track on Exercism.
As you bring on new co-maintainers, have them add themselves to the file as well.

## Write "getting started" instructions for people using the track

We need to guide people through the process of getting their development environment working, and make sure they know how to run the tests.

As a bonus, we could provide some links to learning resources for people who are completely new to the language, and resources that come in handy while they're developing.

More on this in the [documentation about documentation](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/documentation/for-consumers.md).
