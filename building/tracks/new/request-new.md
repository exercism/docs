# Request a new Language Track

Please follow the instructions below to request a new Language Track.

## Does Exercism already support the language?

Please [check the list of track repositories](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aexercism-track+org%3Aexercism+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) to find both active and inactive tracks.

If you find a repository for the language you're interested in, check the repository's `config.json` file for the value of its `active` key.
If the `active` key is set to `true`, the track is active and will be listed
 within its repository to see if it has an `active` key, which will be true or false. If you'd like to help out, please open an issue on that repository to say hello.

## Has someone else asked for it?

Do a search in the issues in this repository for the name of the language. Remember to check both open and closed issues.

## It doesn't exist - I want to create it!

Awesome!! Please open a [new issue](https://github.com/exercism/request-new-language-track/issues/new), filling out the template. We'll take a look!
