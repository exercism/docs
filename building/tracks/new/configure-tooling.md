# Configure tooling

There are three bits of tooling that you can optionally tweak for your track:

- The **[Lines of Code Counter](/docs/building/tooling/lines-of-code-counter)**
- The **[Snippet Extractor](/docs/building/tooling/snippet-extractor)**
- The **[Exercism CLI](/docs/building/tooling/cli)**

While tweaking these tools is optional, doing so can make your track's integration into the website just _that_ bit better.
