# Configure tooling

There are three bits of tooling that you should tweak for your track:

- The **[Lines of Code Counter](/docs/building/tooling/lines-of-code-counter)**: this tool is tasked with counting the lines of code for each submitted iteration.
- The **[Snippet Extractor](/docs/building/tooling/snippet-extractor)**: this tool extracts a snippet for each iteration, which is shown on the website.
- The **[Exercism CLI](/docs/building/tooling/cli)**: this tool is used by students to work on a track locally, on their own machine.

```exercism/note
Even though tweaking these tools is optional, it'll make your track's integration into the website _much_ better.
Therefore, we highly recommend you tweak all three tools.
