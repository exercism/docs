# Find Maintainers

For a track to be successful, it is important to have a handful of people that will maintain the track.
These people are (unsurprisingly) known as the _track maintainers_.
The tasks of these maintainers can range from reviewing PRs to bug fixing to adding new exercises.

Having a couple of track maintainers is especially important once the track is launched, as students will be enrolling and working on the exercises.

The adding of maintainers is a manual task.
You can request a maintainer to be added by opening an issue and tagging `@exercism/staff`.
