# Dynamic syntax highlighting

Dynamic syntax highlighting is highlighting of code that the user can change.
There is only one place where this happens, and that is the online editor.

```exercism/note
Code snippets, iterations, and the like are _static_ as the user can't change their code on the fly.
If you'd like to know more of how we handle static syntax highlighting, check the [static syntax highlighting docs](/docs/building/tracks/new/enable-syntax-highlighting/statuc).
