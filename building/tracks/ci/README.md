At Exercism, we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to handle our [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) and [continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) (CD) needs.
This includes running tests, formatting things, and deploying things.
