# Contributing via GitHub

Contributions to the Exercism code base are made via [GitHub][github].

As indicated by its name, GitHub uses [git][git] as its version control system.
If you're unfamiliar with Git, the best online resource is [Pro Git][pro-git].

In case you are not familiar with GitHub and the contribution workflow, here are some resources that might help you getting started:

- [Introduction to GitHub - Interactive Course][github-course]
- [How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub - Tutorial][pr-tutorial]
- [How To Make a Simple GitHub PR - Video by anthonywritescode][anthonywritescode]

## Guides

You can read more about how to make sure your contribution is welcome in the [How to make a great Pull Request][great-pr] guide.

We also have several Exercism-specific Pull Request guides:

- [How to make a great Pull Request][how-to-make-a-great-pr]
- [The Contributors' Guide to Pull Requests][contributors-pr-guide]
- [The Maintainers' Guide to Pull Requests][maintainers-pr-guide]
