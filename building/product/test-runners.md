# Test Runners

A Test Runner is a piece of software that runs a an exercise's tests against a student's code.

Test Runners give us two advantages:

1. They enable in-browser coding, where a student can iterate on a solution seeing whether the tests pass or fail.
2. They allow us to provide information to mentors on whether a student's code "works" or not.
