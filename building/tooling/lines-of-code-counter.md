# Lines of Code Counter

The Lines of Code (LoC) Counter takes a solution and counts its lines of code.

By default, only the LoC of files submitted by the student are counted.
If the student submitted a test file, those will be ignored.

While this works well for most submissions, some tracks might need to ignore additional files.
For that, we'll allow the Lines of Code Counter to be [customized per track][lines-of-code-counter-customize].
