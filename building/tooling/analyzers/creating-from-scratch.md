# Creating an Analyzer

Firstly, thank you for your interest in creating an Analyzer!

These are the steps to get going:

1. Check [our repository list for an existing `...-analyzer`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aexercism+analyzer&type=repositories) to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
2. Scan the [contents of this directory](/docs/building/tooling/analyzers) to ensure you are comfortable with the idea of creating an Analyzer.
3. Start a new topic on [the Exercism forum][building-exercism] telling us which language you'd like to create a Test Runner for.
4. Once an Analyzer repo has been created, use [the Analyzer interface document](/docs/building/tooling/analyzers/interface) to help guide your implementation.

We have an incredibly friendly and supportive community who will be happy to help you as you work through this! If you get stuck, please start a new topic on [the Exercism forum][building-exercism] or create new issues at [exercism/exercism][exercism-repo] as needed 🙂
