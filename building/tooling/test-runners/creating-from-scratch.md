# Creating a Test Runner

Firstly, thank you for your interest in creating a Test Runner!

These are the steps to get going:

1. Check [our repository list for an existing `...-test-runner`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aexercism+test-runner&type=repositories) to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
2. Scan the [contents of this directory](/docs/building/tooling/test-runners) to ensure you are comfortable with the idea of creating an Test Runner.
3. Start a new topic on [the Exercism forum][building-exercism] telling us which language you'd like to create a Test Runner for.
4. Once a Test Runner repo has been created for you, use [the Test Runner interface](/docs/building/tooling/test-runners/interface) and [Best practices](/docs/building/tooling/best-practices) documents to help guide your implementation.

We have an incredibly friendly and supportive community who will be happy to help you as you work through this!
If you get stuck, please start a new topic on [the Exercism forum][building-exercism] or create new issues at [exercism/exercism][exercism-repo] as needed ðŸ™‚
