# Creating a Test Runner

Firstly, thank you for your interest in creating a Test Runner!

These are the steps to get going:

1. Check [our repository list for an existing `...-test-runner`](https://github.com/exercism?q=-test-runner) to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
2. Scan the [contents of this directory](/docs/building/tooling/test-runners) to ensure you are comfortable with the idea of creating an Test Runner.
3. Open an issue at [exercism/exercism][exercism-repo] introducing yourself and telling us which language you'd like to create a Test Runner for.
4. Once a Test Runner repo has been created, use [the Test Runner interface document](/docs/building/tooling/test-runners/interface) to help guide your implementation. There is a [generic test runner repository template](https://github.com/exercism/generic-test-runner/) that you can use to kick-start development.

We have an incredibly friendly and supportive community who will be happy to help you as you work through this! If you get stuck, please speak to us on Slack or create new issues at [exercism/exercism][exercism-repo] as needed 🙂
