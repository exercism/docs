# Pronouns

In Grammar, pronouns are words that can be substituted for nouns.
For example, if Exercism's co-founder, Jeremy, was to declare my love for Exercism, rather than saying "**Jeremy** loves **Exercism**", Jeremy might say "**I** love **you**".
Both "I" and "you" are pronouns, that replace the nouns "Jeremy" and "Exercism".

Many languages have gendered pronouns.
For example, as Jeremy's gender is male, we can say **he** loves Exercism.
If Jeremy was female, we could say **she** loves Exercism.

Some people don't like others to know their gender.
This is often the case when someone feels that they might be descriminate against based on their gender, or they value their privacy to the extent where they don't want others to know much about them.
In these situations people sometimes specify **they** as their gender (e.g. "they love Exercism"), or a gender-netural pronoun, such as **ze** (e.g. "ze loves Exercism").

For many people, being addressed by the wrong pronouns can be extremely annoying, and often offensive.
We therefore allow people to specify the pronouns they'd like to be addressed by, and then show these pronouns in situations where interaction occurs (e.g. when writing a testimonial).

You can set your pronouns by filling in the blanks in a sample sentence on [your settings page](https://exercism.lol/settings).
We provide some common options for you to use, but you can write whatever you like.

- If you choose "Use handle", we'll suggest people always use your handle, rather than pronouns when refering to you.
- If you choose "Leave blank", we won't show any pronouns or suggestions at all.

If you see people's pronouns listed, please respect them.
