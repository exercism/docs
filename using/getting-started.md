# Getting Started

Welcome to Exercism!

There is tons of things to do on Exercism, the key options being:

- Become fluent in one of 50+ programming languages
- Mentor students to help them improve their fluency
- Help build Exercism

## Learn a Programming Language

The primary goal of Exercism is to help people become fluent in their programming language of choice.
Exercism help you become more fluent in a programming language by solving exercises.

There are over 50 programming languages to choose from, with tons of variety.
To start learning a programming language, first find the language you want to learn on the [tracks page](/tracks).

Once you've decided upon a language, go to its track page and join the track.
After having joined a track, you'll immediately be able to start [solving exercises](/docs/using/solving-exercises).

By completing exercises (meaning: writing an implementation that passes all the tests) you'll get access to even more exercises, improving your fluency as you go.

If you're ever stuck on an exercise, you can request help from a mentor.
A mentor will then engage in a conversation with you to help you get unstuck.

Have fun learning!

## Mentor Students

Want to help share your knowledge with others?
Then [mentoring](/mentoring) is perfect for you!

Mentoring is a fun and rewarding way to reinforce your own learning, while helping others learn and discover things they don't know.
Mentoring also earns [reputation](/docs/building/product/reputation).
