# Research Edition

In 2019, we launched Exercism Research - a subsite of Exercism focussed on using our data and community to learn more about we learn.

With the launch of Exercism v3 we have retired the subsite, and instead are intending to fold the features of Exercism Research into Exercism Standard Edition.
Everyone will be able to opt in to joining our research program and then be offered experiments to take part in as part of the learning journey.

We'll be announcing more about this in early 2022.
