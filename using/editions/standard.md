# Standard Edition

Exercism Standard Edition is designed for individuals to use for their personal learning, while helping each other through our community systems.

It is not designed or intended for organizations to use to train staff, or to power bootcamps.
See [Teams Edition](/docs/editions/teams) for how you can achieve those goals.
