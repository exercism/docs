# Teams Edition

Exercism has always been used by teams to help each other learn.
In fact, that was how it originally started, as a tool for Katrina teaching students in her bootcamp.

However, as Exercism grew, the small-team aspects didn't fit with our larger mentoring platform, and so we separated that out into a separate edition: Exercism Teams.

With the launch of Exercism v3, we have now shut down Exercism Teams.
However, we are intending to relaunch it in early 2022, as a fully thought-through product, with a whole range of exciting features.

We'll be announcing more about this in early 2022.
