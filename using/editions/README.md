# Editions

Exercism has three different "editions":

- [**Standard:**](/docs/using/editions/standard): The Exercism that everyone knows and loves. Entirely free, community-powered, personal learning.
- [**Research:**](/docs/using/editions/research): Our research edition, allowing us to work with leading scientists to learn more about how people learn to code.
- [**Teams:**](/docs/using/editions/teams): Our edition for small teams (e.g. colleagues at work) or organisations (e.g. Bootcamps).
