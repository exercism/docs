# Automated Feedback

When a solution is submitted, Exercism will automatically analyze the solution in the background, looking for known patterns that it can give feedback on.
Any feedback gathered during this analysis will automatically be shown on the submitted iteration's page.

## What is the difference between Automated Feedback and Mentor Feedback?

The main advantage of automated feedback is it being gathered automatically and thus presented to the student sooner than mentor feedback would.

The main advantage of mentor feedback is that you can engage in a dialog with a mentor on their feedback.
Mentor are also able to write more targeted feedback (e.g. using previous student interactions).

Automated feedback and mentor feedback are presented differently on the website.

## What if I work locally using the CLI?

As automated feedback is only gathered for submitted solutions, CLI users need to first submit the solution and then check the solution's page on the website to see if there was automated feedback.
