# Automated Feedback

When a solution is submitted, Exercism will automatically analyze the solution in the background, looking for known problems that we can give feedback on.
Any feedback gathered during this analysis will automatically be shown on the submitted iteration's page.

## What if I work locally using the CLI?

As automated feedback is only generated for submitted solutions, CLI users need to first submit the solution and then check the solution's page on the website to see if there is automated feedback.
