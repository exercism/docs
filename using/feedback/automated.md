# Automated Feedback

When a solution is submitted, Exercism will automatically analyze the solution in the background, looking for known patterns that it can give feedback on.
Any feedback gathered during this analysis will automatically be shown on the submitted iteration's page.

Automated feedback is presented differently from mentor feedback on the website.

## What if I work locally using the CLI?

As automated feedback is only gathered for submitted solutions, CLI users need to first submit the solution and then check the solution's page on the website to see if there was automated feedback.
