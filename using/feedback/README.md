# Feedback

There are two types of feedback you can get on a solution:

1. [Automated Feedback](/docs/using/feedback/automated)
2. [Mentor Feedback](/docs/using/feedback/mentor)

You can also receive [private mentor feedback](/docs/using/feedback/from-a-friend) from a friend or colleague.

## What is the difference between Automated Feedback and Mentor Feedback?

The main advantage of automated feedback is it being gathered automatically and thus presented to the student sooner than mentor feedback would.

The main advantage of mentor feedback is that you can engage in a dialog with a mentor on their feedback.
Mentors are also able to write more targeted feedback (e.g. using previous student interactions).

Automated feedback and mentor feedback are presented differently on the website.
