# Mentor Feedback

You can get feedback from a mentor by clicking on the "Request mentoring" button on an exercise's page.

## How long will it take before I get feedback from a mentor?

This depends on several factors, such as the ratio of students/mentors for a track. Rest assured that our mentors will do their best to give feedback as soon as possible.

## What if I work locally using the CLI?

As mentor feedback can only be requested for submitted solutions, CLI users need to first submit the solution and then go to the exercise's page on the website and request mentoring.
