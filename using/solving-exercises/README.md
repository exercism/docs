# Solving Exercises

The primary way in which Exercism helps you learn is by solving exercises.

There are two ways to solve exercises on Exercism:

1. [Online via the website's in-browser editor](./solving-exercises/using-the-online-editor)
2. [On your local machine via the CLI](./solving-exercises/working-locally)

## Which option should I choose?

There are different trade-offs between using the online editor or CLI:

|            | Online editor                          | CLI                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Installing | No                                     | Yes (e.g. SDK)                               |
| Editing    | Browser                                | Your preferred editor                        |
| Testing    | Run tests on website                   | Run tests locally                            |
| Debugging  | Limited support (only for some tracks) | Full support (depending on your environment) |

In general, the online editor is ideal for starting new tracks, whereas the CLI-based approach is great if you want to use your own, personalized coding environment.
