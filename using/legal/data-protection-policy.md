# Data Protection Policy

## Overview

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is UK legislation that governs how we process data originating from users from the UK.
Exercism aims to be GDPR compliant for all users, even those outside the UK, and you therefore have some important rights applicable to our Platform.

1. **Your Right to be Informed:**
   This Privacy Policy details who we are, what we collect, and what we use it for.
2. **Right of access:**
   At any time you can review the information on your profile and update or change it.
   Through the exercism.org website you can view all your solutions.
3. **Right of portability:**
   We can provide you with a copy of your personal data in a machine readable format.
   Please contact privacy@exercism.org for more information.
4. **Right to Erasure:**
   We can remove your personal data from our systems so that you can no longer be personally identified to your solutions.
   See the section below for details on how to remove your account.

It is important to note that any content you upload to the site (including, but not limited to, solutions to exercises, comments, and mentor feedback) is transferred to us under a non-revocable license and therefore cannot be deleted from the Platform.

## Deleting your data

To delete your data, please log into your account, visit the [Settings page](https://exercism.org/settings), click "Delete Account" and follow the confirmation instructions.

### Deleting data via email

We take the risk of unintential data loss very seriously, and actively protect against malicious attempts to delete users data through email impersonation.
The Information Commissioner's Office [states](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/) that organisations "have a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly" and "if you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information".
In order to comply with our obligations and to verify that you are the account holder, you must log into the platform to delete your data.
We cannot delete your data in response to an email.

Should you be unable to access your account in order to delete it, please contact privacy@exercism.org and we will assist you.
