A collection is a data structure that is used to store and organize a collection of data items.

Collections provide a convenient way to work with groups of related data items, and they are used extensively in programming for a variety of purposes.
These are some of the main collection types:

- **[Lists](./lists)**: Lists are one of the most basic and commonly used collection types in programming.
  A list is an ordered collection of elements, where each element can be accessed by an index.
  Lists can contain elements of any data type, and they are often used to store sequences of data that need to be accessed in a specific order.

- **[Linked Lists](./linked-lists)**:
  Linked Lists are similar to lists, but rather than accessing items via an index, each element is connected to the next element through a "link" or "pointer".
  Linked Lists are particularly useful when you need to insert or delete items in the middle of the list.
  They come in two types - [single linked lists](./linked-lists) and [double linked lists](double-linked-lists).

- **Arrays**:
  Arrays are another common collection type that are used to store sequences of elements.
  Like lists, arrays are ordered collections of elements, but they are typically fixed in size and can only contain elements of a single data type.
  Arrays are often used for data processing and mathematical operations.

- **Sets**:
  Sets are collections of unique elements, where each element can only appear once in the set.
  Sets are often used for operations that require finding unique elements or comparing multiple sets.

- **Maps**:
  Maps (also known as dictionaries, associative arrays and hashes) are collections that store elements in key-value pairs.
  Each element in the map is associated with a unique key, which is used to retrieve the corresponding value.
  Maps are often used to store and access data in a structured way.

- **Queues**:
  Queues are collections that are used to store elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.
  Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue, in the order in which they were added.
  Queues are often used in algorithms and data processing.

- **Stacks**:
  Stacks are collections that are used to store elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
  Elements are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top of the stack, in the opposite order in which they were added.
  Stacks are often used in algorithms and data processing.

In addition to these main collection types, there are many other specialized collection types that are used in programming, such as trees, heaps, and graphs.
Each collection type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right collection for a specific task can be an important part of programming.
