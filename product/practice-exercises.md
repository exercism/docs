# Practice Exercises

Practice Exercises aim to give a student practice in bringing multiple concepts together and exploring how to solve a problem, without prompting, in a given language.

Each exercise has prerequisite concepts. A Practice Exercise is unlocked once a student has successfully completed Concept Exercises for the prerequisite concepts.
