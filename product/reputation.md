# Reputation

Reputation is the system that allows people to acquire "trust" within the Exercism ecosystem.

Reputation is a measure of how much an individual has contributed to Exercism, both through contribution to the platform (e.g. through creation of software, exercises and docs) and contribution to the community (e.g. mentoring).

Reputation cannot be "spent" or "used". However, achieving certain Reputation thresholds gives access to new privileges and ways to contribute. Put simply, the more reputation an individual has, the more we feel we can trust them, and so the more power they receive. Reputation is also a publicly-viewable measure of how much you have given to Exercism.

## Purpose

The purpose of the reputation system is to:
1. Maximise growth-centric interactions between students and mentors
2. Maximise the desire of mentors to want to contribute

## Acquisition of Reputation

Reputation can be acquired in a variety of ways:
1. Mentoring others' solutions successfully
2. Writing analysers
3. Updating analysers
4. Creating documentation
5. Updating documentation

### 1. Mentoring others' solutions successfully
Algorithm for determining the allocation of reputation points per mentoring interaction is yet to be determined.

## Ideas for consideration
- Assigning more reputation where the back-and-forth between student and mentor is longer. Encourages mentors to stick it through and thoroughly deal with the solution.
