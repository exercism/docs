# Credits

Credits are Exercism's currency. They are our core mechanism of ensuring those that give more to Exercism can get more from Exercism.

Credits are acquired by doing things, and can be "spent" within Exercism and can also be traded for discounts on Exercism swag.

## Acquiring Credits

### New Accounts

When creating a new account an individual receives an initial amount of credits.

### Birthdays

A user receives a credit "present" each year upon their Exercism birthday.

### Mentoring

Every time someone requests mentoring, they add a bounty to their request. The mentor who successfully mentors that solution receives that bounty.

In general, a user's [mentoring reputation](../reputation.md) determines the max bounty they can receive. The more someone mentors (successfully), the better bounties they have access to and the more credits they can acquire.

## Spending Credits

### Mentoring

A bounty is attached to each mentoring request. The higher the bounty, the more attractive the mentoring request is to users and the higher up the mentoring list it appears.

### Swag

Credits can be exchanged for discounts on Exercism swag, bringing the cost down to the cost of production+shipping.
