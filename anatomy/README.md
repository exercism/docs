# The Anatomy of Exercism

The documents explore different areas of Exercism:

1) how we have built each of the areas
2) Technical specifications for each of the areas.

These documents are written for maintainers and contributors to Exercism, rather than end-users, and so may presume more innate knowledge of Exercism.

- **[Track](./tracks):** The documents making up a Track.
- **[Track Tooling](./track-tooling):** The production tooling created by Tracks.
