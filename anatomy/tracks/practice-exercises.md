# Practice Exercises

Practice Exercises are exercises designed to allow students to solve an arbitary problem, with the aim of them making use of the concepts they have learnt so far.

## Metadata

Practice Exercise metadata is defined in the `exercises.practice` key in the [config.json file](./config-json.md#practice-exercises). The metadata defines the exercise's UUID, slug and more.
