# The Mentoring Mindset

## What _is_ a mindset?

Before examining the mentoring mindset, it may be helpful to understand what a mindset is.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, `Mindset` is an "established set of attitudes, esp. regarded as typical of a particular group's social or cultural values."
A person may have an individual motivation for engaging in an activity, but a mindset directs that the motivation is in line with a group's values.
For the Exercism mentor, that means approaching the mentoring process within the spirit of the Exercism community.

## The spirit of the Exercism community

It can be helpful to review the intent of Exercism as expressed on the [About][exercism-about] page.
All of it is worth reading and considering, especially

- "Weâ€™re building a place where anyone can learn and master programming for free, without ever feeling lost or stupid."
- "Exercism should encourage a growth-mindset, clear and empathetic communication, and emphasize the value in learning together."
- "Exercism should feel safe and nurturing."
- "Exercism focusses on the learning journey, not the destination. The process and enjoyment of learning is more important than absolute factual correctness."

## The spirit of the mentee

Some mentees may start their comment with something self-deprecatory.
They may something like "I'm not very smart" or "I don't understand" or "I'm not very good at this".
It may be tempting to address such statements directly in the Exercism spirit of empathy and nurturing.
As a mentor, though, it may be more effective to express the specific things you like about their solution
than to give them some kind of vague reassurance.
If there is nothing you can honestly praise about their solution, you can congratulate them on passing the tests,
or, if they didn't pass the tests, at least acknowledge their effort.

Some mentees may start their comment with something that may come across as negative.
They may say something like "Why do I have to do so-and-so?"
It may feel as if they are complaining, "Why do I have to eat my peas? I _hate_ peas!"
You may be put off from mentoring the person because it seems to be off to a confrontational start.
But what can seem like defiance or a complaint could just be a simple inquiry, even if expressed a bit abruptly.
It's best to ignore what emotion their comment may have triggered and simply respond to the question.

Those are just two examples illustrating how the perceived spirit of the mentee should not affect the attitude of the mentor in responding to them.

## The spirit of the mentor

The basic spirit of the mentor could be either of pride or humility.
A mentor may feel they are _entitled_ to mentor because they are smart and/or have a certain amount of experience.
They may feel they should mentor because they know better than others.
A mentor whose spirit is based in pride may may still approach the mentee with patience and polite guidance,
even though it may be more out of magnanimity than empathy.

Or a mentor may have the spirit of humility.
They may be keenly aware of what challenges they faced in learning how to program.
They may know they don't have all the answers, but they know _some_, and they are willing to share their hard-earned knowledge.
A mentor whose spirit is based in humility is still human, and may be tempted to respond to a difficult mentoring session in a
curt or argumentative way.
Even a person with the best intentions needs to be vigilant when having a bad day.

## The spirit of the truth

Factual correctness is certainly important and has its place.
For example, it's important that imperial units of measurement are not used where metric units of measurement are expected.
