# The Mentoring Mindset

## What is a mindset?

Before examining the mentoring mindset, it may be helpful to understand what a mindset is.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, `Mindset` is an "established set of attitudes, esp. regarded as typical of a particular group's social or cultural values."
A person may have an individual motivation for engaging in an activity, but a mindset directs that the motivation is in line with a group's values.
For the Exercism mentor, that means approaching the mentoring process within the spirit of the Exercism community.

## The spirit of the Exercism community

It can be helpful to review the intent of Exercism as expressed on the [About][exercism-about] page.
All of it is worth reading and considering, especially

- "Weâ€™re building a place where anyone can learn and master programming for free, without ever feeling lost or stupid."
- "Exercism should encourage a growth-mindset, clear and empathetic communication, and emphasize the value in learning together."
- "Exercism should feel safe and nurturing."
- "Exercism focusses on the learning journey, not the destination. The process and enjoyment of learning is more important than absolute factual correctness."

## The spirit of the mentee

Some mentees may start their comment with something self-deprecatory.
They may something like "I'm not very smart" or "I don't understand" or "I'm not very good at this".
It may be tempting to address such statements directly in the Exercism spirit of empathy.
As a mentor, it may be more effective to express the specific things you like about their solution
than to give some kind of vague reassurance.
If there is nothing you think can be honestly praised about their solution, you can congratulate them on passing the tests,
or, if they didn't pass the tests, at least acknowledge their effort.

Some mentees may start their comment with something that may come across as defiant.
They may say something like "Why do I have to do so-and-so?"
But what can seem like defiance can be a simple inquiry.
