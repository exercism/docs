# How to use Markdown in mentoring

You can use markdown in your mentoring comments on GitHub.
This allows you to embed code snippets, add headings, bold, italic, lists, etc, and quote previous sentences.

We also allow some elements of "Github-flavoured Markdown" on Exercism, specifically Syntax highlighting, Tables, and Strikethrough

If you're not familiar with Markdown or the GitHub extras, we recommend reading the [GitHub guide to Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
