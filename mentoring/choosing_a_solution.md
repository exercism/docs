# Choosing a solution to mentor

The first decision to make as a mentor is which solution to provide student feedback. Consider your depth of knowledge and the student's abilities.
- Are you comfortable with the exercise and the solution?
- Can you answer the student's questions?
- Can you meet the student's goals?

Does the student's knowledge gap match your expertise?
- If they're new to the language and looking to learn the basics you'll probably be able to help if you have any experience. 
- If they've been programming in the language for years and trying to hit expert-level, you'll need to have a pretty solid grasp of the language yourself.

The process to mentor a student is:
1. Explore the solutions
1. Understand the solution
1. Ask questions about the code and solution
1. Select the solution
1. Select the student to mentor

The first decision you need to make as a mentor is which solution to mentor.

## Working with the Queue

You can find a list of all solutions that have been submitted for mentoring in the [Mentoring Queue](/mentoring/queue).

The screen looks like this:

[TODO: Image of queue].

Once you have found a solution that looks like it might be a good fit for you to provide student feedback, take the next step and have a look at the code.  

Click the solution and enter the Mentoring Discussion screen to ask questions about the code and solution.

## The Mentoring Discussion Screen
The main table shows the exercise, the student, and when they requested mentoring.
Hovering on a row gives you more detail.
You can see more about the user: their name, location, and reputation.
You will also see a blurb they have written that may explain what they are looking to get out of the track.
As you start mentoring people, you will also see whether you have mentored them before, and if you have favorited them.

At this stage you are looking at someone else's solution, but have not yet committed to providing mentoring feedback.
You have the opportunity to read the code and get more information, before starting.  

Post any questions in the discussion screen to get clarification on the solution.

## The Student
If you have a particular student you would like to mentor, search for the student using the filter box, order by oldest or most recent.  

On the right-hand side of the screen, filter by language or exercise.  

You can also choose to only show exercises you have completed yourself (enabled by default). This is a great starting point until you are comfortable with higher level exercises.

The main table shows the exercise, the student and when they requested mentoring.
Hovering over a row gives you more detail about the user:  
- Name
- Location
- Reputation (an indicator if they are a contributor or mentor)
- How many times they have been mentored before   

The information on the tooltip is a preliminary indicator whether this student is a right match for you.
You will see information they've written explaining what they are looking to get out of the track. 

As you start mentoring students, you will see whether you have mentored them before, and if you have added them as a favorite.


### The student's code

On the left hand side of the screen you will see the student's code.  

The screen looks like this:

[TODO: Image of mentor discussion with areas marked].

1. The main part on the left side contains the student's code.
   By default you'll be seeing their most recent iteration.
   If they've submitted multiple iterations, you can switch through these using the numbers in circles at the bottom.
   If they've only submitted one iteration, you won't see those icons.

2. The tabs at the top shows the student's code, the tests, and the instructions.
   This is useful for reminding yourself about what the student has been asked to do in this exercise.

3. There is an indicator showing whether a test has passed or failed.
   If they failed, click the indicator to open a report showing the specific details of their test and what they did wrong.

On the right hand side, you'll see three tabs.
The overview tab will contain the same information about the user that you saw on the tooltip.
Below that you'll see a comment for the user about what it is that they want to learn from this specific solution.
(For some older solutions, this might be missing).  

The guidance tab provides the following information:

   1. **Mentor notes:** These are community-written notes that help point other mentors towards the best way to mentor an exercise.
  We'd really love you to contribute your experience back to these notes.
   1. **Automated feedback:** This is feedback that our analyzers have determined might be useful for you to give to a student.
  We'll discuss this more later.
   1. **Your solution:** A link back to your own solution, which you can use as a reference for how you solved the exercise.

## Start Mentoring

If you've read the code, checked the guidance, and feel you can be helpful, then it's time to get going!
