# Being a Good Citizen of Exercism 

We want Exercism to be a great place to spend time, whoever you are.
To ensure that Exercism is that, we place a strong focus on being good community citizens.
This is formalised in our [Code of Conduct](https://exercism.io/code-of-conduct) but can be summed up simply in one sentence: **Be kind.**

## The words we use

There are lots of ways to embrace being kind within Exercism but the most powerful is to consider how your words affect others.

Words in themselves are meaningless. 
They are vibrations caused by puffs of air coming out of our lungs.
However, because of **context**, words are powerful.

It's easy to know how you intend your words to come across, but it's difficult to know how others hear your words.
What we say is strongly tempered by our experiences in life, our cultural norms, and our primary spoken language.
We believe it's better to choose words that are **clear** and **unambiguous** across cultures, and where possible, across spoken languages.
This means being careful when using metaphors, acronyms or phrases that might only be understandable to someone from a specific background or with specific knowledge.
It also means being open to learning about how people from different cultures might misunderstand your intentions, and changing the words you use accordingly.

One example is that within Exercism we ask people not to use the word "guys" unless explicitely addressing a group of men. 
While in many places the word "guys" can refer to a group of people irrespective of gender, in many other places it explicitly means "men".
So, regardless of the intention of the speaker, the person hearing the word "guys" understands the speaker to be only addressing only men, and feels excluded.
In tech, where women are in the strong miniority, this adds yet another sense of negativity and exclusion.

For some people who are used to using the word "guys" to mean a group of people irrespective of gender, this rule can seem pedantic or irrational.
However, when guided by the principle of using communication that is clear and unambiguous, and driven by being kind to others in the community, it becomes clear that the word "guys" does not convey the intended meaning to the receiver and may cause a sense of exclusion, and so we choose to use clearer words.

~~~~note
Our co-founder, Jeremy, is from the UK, where the British dictionary explicitely states that "guys" is a gender neutral word.
In real life, he commonly addresses groups of women using the word "guys". 
However, in an international setting such as conferences, or within on multi-national platform such as Exercism, he would choose to use a clearer word such as "folks" (or occasionally y'all when he's feeling particuarly Texan)

## Remember that we're all human

Just as it is important to say the right things, it is equally important to understand that people who cause offence might have had no intention to do so.
Cultural differences mean that people often say things that would be clear to them and their friends to mean one thing, but mean something entirely different to you.
In those situations, **give the person the benefit of the doubt.** 
It is always best to presume that someone is acting with the intentions of being clear and kind, and that they are unaware of how their words will affect others.
As with so much of Exercism, you don't know what you don't know, and it's easy to accidentally say the wrong thing.

The important thing is not the mistake, it is the learning and the change that comes from it.
So if someone says something that you feel is offensive, and you feel comfortable doing so, feel free to tell them.
And if someone tells you you've said something that is offensive to them, believe them, and embrace the experience of learning more about that other culture, and extending your communication skills to not cause offense in future.

The beauty of Exercism is about making mistakes and learning from them. 
Exercism is brilliant at helping with that through mentoring, but it's also brilliant at introducing you to new ideas and information through our huge multinational community.
Embrace it!
