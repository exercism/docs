# Markdown Specification

The following is the way that all Markdown files within Exercism should be structured.

Some of the rules in this document are not yet implemented across Exercism.
We welcome PRs to fix them.
All rules are being added to our CI and linting tools.

## Headings

- All files must start start with a level-1 heading (`# Some heading text`).
- Level-1 headings exist purely for consuming on GitHub or equivalent.
- If the file is rendered by Exercism (e.g. displayed on the website, rendered via the CLI), this heading will be removed, and a contextual heading will be inserted.
- No heading may decend a level greater than one below the previous (e.g. `##` may only be followed by `###`, not `####`)
- Beyond the single level-1 (`#`) heading, only level-2 (`##`), level-3 (`###`) and level-4 (`####`) headings may be used.
