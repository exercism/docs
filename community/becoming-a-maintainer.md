# Becoming a maintainer

## Introduction

Our Maintainers are the people within Exercism that manage the different parts of our ecosystem. 
We aim to have at least active two maintainers for each programming language track, and at least one active maintainer for all the parts of the platform.

We have a formalised process for becoming and staying a maintainer, to make it achievable and fair for anyone.
**You can be become a maintainer!**
Read on to understand the responsibilities and the process.

_Note: the second below generally discussses Track Maintainers. 
The process for becoming a maintainer of a different part of the ecosystem is similar but a little looser._

## Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that a Track works well within Exercism, and continues to grow and develop. 
That specifically means that maintainers:
- **Set technical direction for a track:** Choosing the right language versions, tooling, etc.
- **Manage the syllabus of a track:** Designing, choosing and defining the right Concepts and Exercises for a Track, and ensuring they are linked and structured appropriately.
- **Ensure a traack track work well:** Ensuring the Track is up to date, that its test-runner is fast, etc.
- **Ensure the track conforms to Exercism's standard:** Exercism has specifications and standards for each language Track to ensure a degree of consistency within the platform. While maintainers have free reign over much of the Track, all Tracks must conform to Exercism's standards.

Maintainers are also responsibile for interacting with our contributor community.
They review PRs from community, acting as gatekeepers, shephards, and cheerleaders for our community.
They are responsible for keeping documentation and contribution guidelines up to date, and ensuring that there are relevant open issues for potential contributors to action.

It is essential that Maintainers manifest Exercism's values of empathy and kindness, while maintaining high standards for the Track and the platform.

## Powers

The primary way that Maintainers are able to their enact their responsibilities is by having the write access to repositories. 
Through this Maintainers control what code goes into their repositories.

## Rewards

The main incentives for being an Exercism Maintainer are intrinsic: working on a meaningful project; working with other smart, kind people; developing both technical and soft skills; having a meaningful out-of-work entry on your résumé.

We also provide some extra benefits in:
- A "Maintainer" badge on profiles and around the website.
- Blog posts and interviews with maintainers.
- Exclusive Maintainer swag

## Maintainer requirements 

Maintainers commit themselves to spending an average of ~4 hours per week on maintaining their Track(s).

### Path to becoming a Maintainer

On tracks that are actively maintained, you will be invited to become a Maintainer when you achieve 150 building and/or authoring reputation on that Track within a 6 month period. 

On tracks without maintainers, we have less rigorous restrictions.
After some small merged contributions, you can open an issue on the Track asking to become a Maintainer.

### Staying a maintainer

Every six months we check to see if our Maintainers are still active. 
In those checks, anyone who has built 100 Reputation from building/authoring/maintaining track in previous 6 months is invited to continue being a maintainer.
In general those who have done little or nothing during that window, will be removed as Maintainers.

### Senior Track Maintainers

Once a Maintainer has shown themselves to take active leadership within a track, and been a Maintainer on that Track for at least 6 months, we may designate them a Senior Maintainer. The general metrics we use are a Maintainer having earned >=1k rep from building/maintenance on a track, and earned > 200 rep from building/maintaining track in the last 6 months.

Senior Maintainers take on added responsibility within a track, mentoring new Maintainers, and taking a stronger leadership position within a Track. 
In decisions where there are different approaches, the opinions of Senior Maintainers hold more sway in the eyes of any arbitration by the Admin Team.

Senior Maintainers are designated on the track with a "Senior Maintainer" badge.

# Reviewer Maintainers

The final category of Maintainers are our Reviewer Maintainers — maintainers who work across multiple tracks, reviewing and merging PRs, but do not take proactive or leadership positions on a Track. 
Reviewer Maintainers hare highly trusted members of the Exercism team who have been part of Exercism for at least a year and been Maintainers of at least one track.
They are invited to become Reviewer Maintainers by Exercism Admins. 
Membership is reviewed on a six-monthly basis without any formal requirements.

For Tracks that have fewer than two maintainers, the Reviewers team is automatically added to the Track repository, where they are given write access.
