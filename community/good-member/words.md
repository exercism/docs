# The words we use

Words, in their basic form, are nothing more than sound. Yet, when given context, words possess immense power.

Understanding your own intentions when you speak is straightforward, but grasping how others interpret your words is more complex. Our speech is heavily influenced by our life experiences, cultural norms, and mother tongue. At Exercism, we advocate for choosing words that are comprehensible and unambiguous across different cultures and languages whenever possible. This means we must exercise caution when using metaphors, acronyms, or phrases that might be understood only by individuals with specific backgrounds or knowledge. Additionally, it requires us to remain open to learning about how our words might be misinterpreted by individuals from various cultures and adjusting our language accordingly.

For instance, we at Exercism request that people refrain from using the word "guys." In some places, "guys" is a gender-neutral term referring to a group of people, but in other places, it is explicitly male. Therefore, a person from a culture where "guys" refers only to men might hear the term and feel excluded if they are not male, even if the speaker did not intend to exclude anyone. This issue is especially significant in the tech industry, where men make up the majority, furthering the sense of exclusion for everyone else.

Initially, some may find this rule pedantic or irrational, believing their intentions are clear and they do not mean to exclude anyone. However, when guided by the principle of communicating in a manner that is unambiguous and clear, coupled with a desire to show kindness to others in the community, it becomes apparent that the word "guys" might not convey the intended meaning to everyone. As a result, individuals often opt for clearer, more inclusive language.

```exercism/note
Our co-founder, Jeremy, is from the UK, where the British dictionary explicitly states that "guys" is a gender neutral word.
In real life, he commonly addresses groups of women using the word "guys".
However, in an international setting such as conferences, or within a multi-national platform such as Exercism, he would choose to use a clearer word such as "folks" (or occasionally y'all when he's feeling particularly Texan).
As such, there is no judgement about whether the word "guys" should mean one thing or another or is good or bad, purely that the usage of the word should change with context.

### You don't know what you don't know

Just as it is important to say the right things, it is equally important to understand that people who cause offense might have had no intention to do so.
Cultural differences mean that people often say things that would be clear to them and their friends to mean one thing, but mean something entirely different to you.
Language barriers mean that non-native speakers may use words that don't translate as well as they hope.
In those situations, **give the person the benefit of the doubt.**
It is always best to presume that someone is acting with the intentions of being clear and kind, and that they are unaware of how their words will affect others.
It's easy to not know something will cause offense and accidentally say the wrong thing.

The important thing is not the mistake, it is the learning and the change that comes from it.
So if someone says something that you feel is offensive, and you feel comfortable doing so, feel free to tell them.
And if someone tells you you've said something that is offensive to them, believe them, edit your message to remove or change the relevant text, and embrace the experience of learning more about that other culture, and extending your communication skills to not cause offense in future.

The beauty of Exercism is about making mistakes and learning from them.
Exercism is brilliant at helping with that through mentoring, but it's also brilliant at introducing you to new ideas and information through our huge multinational community.
Embrace it!
