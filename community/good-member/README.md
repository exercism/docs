# Being a Good Exercism Community Member

We want Exercism to be a great place to spend time, whoever you are.
To ensure that Exercism is that, we place a strong focus on being good community members.

This is formalised in our [Code of Conduct](https://exercism.io/code-of-conduct) but can be summed up simply in one sentence: **Be kind.**

There are a few principles to try and keep in mind as you contribute to Exercism.
Whether you're mentoring, learning, hanging out in a chat space, or helping building things on GitHub, if you follow these ideas, you'll find that Exercism can be an incredibly fun and rewarding place to spend time.

- Presume good intentions
- Being wrong is awesome
- You don't know what you don't know

- Choose your words well

## Presume good intentions

The vast majority of people who are involved in Exercism do so because they want to help others.
They're probably passionate about tech, maybe interested in education, but overwhelmingly want to be in a space where they're building something positive with others.

That means that the majority of discussions are happening between two people who want the best for each and also for Exercism.

Sometimes, when disagreements happen its easy to jump to the conclusion that the other person is being difficult, or not listening, or not understanding your point.
It's easy to imagine they're sitting there feeling smug, polishing their ego, while they rile you up with their wrong opinions.
In reality, they're much more likely to be trying to communicate something that they feel is important and not finding a way to do that in a way that is clear to others.

When we step back and presume each other are **tying** to be kind, and trying to do the right things, and trying to be clear, it makes it a lot easier for us to loosen the grip on our own egos and **actively** try to listen to the other person's point.

Which brings us on to...

## Being wrong is awesome

Learning that you're wrong about something is the best thing that can happen to you, because you're now less wrong than you were before.
If you're someone that cares about being scientific in your thinking, in being correct and knowledge, then discovering you're wrong is the most exciting thing possible.

So when you go into a discussion on Exercism, see it as an opportunity not to prove you're right but to discover where you might be wrong, and in doing so become more correct than you were before.

Adam Grant wrote a [whole book on this](https://www.adamgrant.net/book/think-again/).
In it he quotes Ray Dalio saying "If you don't look back at yourself and think, 'Wow how sutpid I was a year ago', then you must not have learned much in the last year".

## You don't know what you don't know

Exercism is built on the tenant that we don't know what we don't know.
The whole platform works around mentors pointing out knowledge gaps that you didn't know you have.
And that works incredibly when both sides are open to knew information (very often its the mentors that realise they didn't know something when seeing new code from a student!)

It's ease to remember that in the context of being a student in a mentoring session, but it's just as important everywhere else within Exercism.
When you think something sucks about the website, start by asking yourself what it is that you might not know â€” a decision that looks ridiculous to you might indicate that your knowledge is missing something just as much as it might indicate that the decision actually **is** ridiculous.

Take a read of our post on [Chesteron's Fence](./being-a-good-community-member/chestertons-fence) to practical examples of how this principle applies.

## Choose your words well

There are lots of ways to embrace being kind within Exercism, but the most powerful is to consider how your words affect others.

In a cross-cultural space full of people from different backgrounds, who share different beliefs, value-systems and natural languages, communicating clearly is a super-power.
It's easy to know how you intend your words to _come across_, but it's difficult to know how others _perceive your words_.

Take a read of [The words that we use](./being-a-good-community-member/the-words-that-we-use) to learn more about why this matters so much.
