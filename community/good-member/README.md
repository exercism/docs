# Being a Good Exercism Community Member

We want Exercism to be a great place to spend time, whoever you are.
To ensure that Exercism is that, we place a strong focus on being good community members.

This is formalised in our [Code of Conduct](https://exercism.io/code-of-conduct) but can be summed up simply in one sentence: **Be kind.**

There are a few principles to try and keep in mind as you contribute to Exercism.
Whether you're mentoring, learning, hanging out in a chat space, or helping building things on GitHub, if you follow these ideas, you'll find that Exercism can be an incredibly fun and rewarding place to spend time.

- Presume good intentions
- Being wrong is awesome
- You don't know what you don't know
- Disagree constructively
- Choose your words carefully

## Presume good intentions

The vast majority of people who are involved in Exercism do so because they want to help others.
They're probably passionate about tech, maybe interested in education, but overwhelmingly want to be in a space where they're building something positive with others.

That means that the majority of discussions are happening between two people who want the best for each and also for Exercism.

Sometimes, when disagreements happen its easy to jump to the conclusion that the other person is being difficult, or not listening, or not understanding your point.
It's easy to imagine they're sitting there feeling smug, polishing their ego, while they rile you up with their wrong opinions.
In reality, they're much more likely to be trying to communicate something that they feel is important and not finding a way to do that in a way that is clear to others.

When we step back and presume each other are **tying** to be kind, and trying to do the right things, and trying to be clear, it makes it a lot easier for us to loosen the grip on our own egos and **actively** try to listen to the other person's point.

Which brings us on to...

## Being wrong is awesome

Learning that you're wrong about something is the best thing that can happen to you, because you're now less wrong than you were before.
If you're someone that cares about being scientific in your thinking, in being correct and knowledge, then discovering you're wrong is the most exciting thing possible.

So when you go into a discussion on Exercism, see it as an opportunity not to prove you're right but to discover where you might be wrong, and in doing so become more correct than you were before.

Adam Grant wrote a [whole book on this](https://www.adamgrant.net/book/think-again/).
In it he quotes Ray Dalio saying "If you don't look back at yourself and think, 'Wow how sutpid I was a year ago', then you must not have learned much in the last year".

## You don't know what you don't know

Exercism is built on the tenant that we don't know what we don't know.
The whole platform works around mentors pointing out knowledge gaps that you didn't know you have.
And that works incredibly when both sides are open to knew information (very often its the mentors that realise they didn't know something when seeing new code from a student!)

It's ease to remember that in the context of being a student in a mentoring session, but it's just as important everywhere else within Exercism.
When you think something sucks about the website, start by asking yourself what it is that you might not know ‚Äî a decision that looks ridiculous to you might indicate that your knowledge is missing something just as much as it might indicate that the decision actually **is** ridiculous.

Take a read of our post on [Chesteron's Fence](./being-a-good-community-member/chestertons-fence) to practical examples of how this principle applies.

## Disagree constructively

A huge part of building a successful product is in people bringing different opinions and discussing them to aim to find truth (or at the very least some constructive way forward).
Disagreeing with each other is therefore a critical component of Exercism.
However, disagreeing constructively is a skill ‚Äî one that is difficult to master.

Here a few guiding points on how to disagree constructively within our community:

### 1. Ask yourself if you need to get involved

So you've found a problem and feel like someone needs to know about it.
The first thing to ask yourself is do they?
Will telling someone that something is wrong make things better?
Are you adding noise or signal?

More often than not, telling someone that they're wrong is great.
You help them address a knowledge gap and help make Exercism better.
But sometimes it's not worth the noise or energy, and correcting someone just makes someone feel worse about themselves.
So before you jump in, just sanity-check whether it's the right thing to do.

### 2. Don't pile in

Closely linked to 1 is our tribal nature of seeing something we have an opinion on and feeling the need to comment.
You see this a lot on GitHub with people adding üëç and üëé emojis onto every comment or spamming a thread with "Me too".
Many people see two people disagreeing and feel they need to "reinforce" the person that is saying what they agree with.

If you're not saying something new, or something useful, ask yourself whether you need to say anything at all.

- Does that üëé just make someone feel rubbish about themselves?
- Is it going to just entrench them further in their position and make them defensive?
- Does adding a üëç make someone else feel like they're right, boost their ego, and entrench them further.
- Does adding a "This is broken for me too" add a useful data point for a maintainer, or just more pressure and urgency?

Each situation is different, but think before you click or type.

### 3. Don't make it personal

So you've got into a disagreement. Great! Now, make it count.

Remember, you're not disagreeing with a person, you're disagreeing with their **current** viewpoint on something.
Ensure you give them room to change without them feeling like they lose face to do so.
Empower them to see the value of your arguments without making them feel stupid that their thoughts were wrong.
Don't make it personal.

A good red flag is if you start needing to quote what someone has said to point out where they were wrong or contradicted themselves.
People contradicting themselves is often a sign of them **evolving their thoughts.**
It doesn't prove their wrong ‚Äî it proves that their letting their mind be creative and exploring different avenues.
Encourage this!

And remember to be your own person.
You don't need to point out that you agree with X or that Y is clearly correct.
It's not about people, it's about finding the best solution.
Add signal, not noise.

### 4. Accept decisions

Often disagreements don't come to conclusions that everyone agrees on.
In fact, in Exercism nearly everything is some sort of compromise.
You will therefore nearly always be a little unhappy with the outcome.

It is critical to being a good community member to accept decisions and embrace them, even if you disagree with them.

Decisions have to consider lots of viewpoints and contain lots of tradeoffs.
What's good for one track might be a little worse for another.
Something might cause you more work than it causes someone else.
A site-wide consideration might be deemed more important than a track-specific one.

If you don't feel you understand why a decision has been made, always feel free to ask.
But once the decision is explained, the onus is on you to accept it even if you don't like it.
In everyone doing this, next time a decision **does** go your way at the cost of someone else's pleasure, you won't feel their guilt or resentment either.

And have faith that decisions are a made in good-faith ‚Äî trying to do the best for the community, the platform, and our students.

## Choose your words carefully

There are lots of ways to embrace being kind within Exercism, but the most powerful is to consider how your words affect others.

In a cross-cultural space full of people from different backgrounds, who share different beliefs, value-systems and natural languages, communicating clearly is a super-power.
It's easy to know how you intend your words to _come across_, but it's difficult to know how others _perceive your words_.

Take a read of [The words that we use](./being-a-good-community-member/the-words-that-we-use) to learn more about why this matters so much.
