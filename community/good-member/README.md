# Being a Good Exercism Community Member

We want Exercism to be a great place to spend time, whoever you are.
To ensure that Exercism is that, we place a strong focus on being good community members.
This is formalised in our [Code of Conduct](https://exercism.io/code-of-conduct) but can be summed up simply in one sentence: **Be kind.**

## The words we use

There are lots of ways to embrace being kind within Exercism, but the most powerful is to consider how your words affect others.

In a cross-cultural space full of people from different backgrounds, who share different beliefs, value-systems and natural languages, communicating clearly is a super-power.
It's easy to know how you intend your words to _come across_, but it's difficult to know how others _perceive your words_.

Take a read of [The words that we use](./the-words-that-we-use) to learn more about why this matters so much.
